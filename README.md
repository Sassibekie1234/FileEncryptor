# FileEncryptor
A file encryption tool in Python using the Vigenère cipher.

I hope the main.py is readable but if it isn't you can ask me for more info by making a github issue.

I wanna thank GeeksForGeeks for thier article on file handling https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python/file-handling-python/
